Solution Highlights
1. Automatic and Manual Approval Logic:
   * Opportunities with a totalAmount below $10,000 and in a Open status are automatically approved and transformed into Sales Orders during the mapping stage.(10 governance points).
   * Opportunities with a totalAmount of $10,000 or more are flagged for manual approval by setting a custom checkbox field (custbody_requires_manual_approval). Also during mapping stage. Record.submitValues(10 governance points).
   * Opportunities that are approved are just transformed into a sales order.
2. Sales Order Transformation:
   * Approved Opportunities are transformed into Sales Orders using the NetSuite record.transform API during the map stage.
   * This transformation is optimized to handle individual Opportunities efficiently while deferring bulk actions (e.g., email notifications) to the reduce stage.
3. Email Notifications:
   * Sales Representatives are notified of newly created Sales Orders via email during the reduce stage, where bulk processing ensures efficiency and scalability. 
   * We will email out a list to each sales rep of the sales orders created.(20 Governance points)
4. Performance Optimization:
   * Leveraging a Map/Reduce architecture ensures parallel processing of Opportunities for scalability, even with daily sync volumes exceeding 500 records.
   * Error handling is embedded in both mapping and reduction stages to manage retries and avoid data loss during failures..
Why This Design?
* Scalability: The Map/Reduce script handles high volumes efficiently, splitting tasks into smaller chunks for parallel processing.
* Separation of Concerns: Dividing the logic into map and reduce stages ensures clarity and modularity:
   * Map: Handles individual record evaluation, approval, and transformation.
   * Reduce: Manages email notifications in bulk for better efficiency. 
Script Walk Through:
* Get Input Data:
   * Query to get need info from oppurtunities(total, status, salesrep, joined to sales rep employee record for email.)
   * Returns asMappedResults
* Mapping
   * Opportunities with a totalAmount below $10,000 and in a Open status are automatically approved and transformed into Sales Orders during the mapping stage.(10 governance points).
   * Opportunities with a totalAmount of $10,000 or more are flagged for manual approval by setting a custom checkbox field (custbody_requires_manual_approval). Also during mapping stage. Record.submitValues(10 governance points).
   * Opportunities that are approved are just transformed into a sales order.
   * These orders are group by there sales rep and passed to the reduce stage
* Reduce
   * Take all the sales order transaction ids and add them to an email.
